/*
    Script for Issue move function from SD to Jira Software Project
    for all users
*/

// TODO: move an active issue from SD to specified projects

/* Requirements:
    User has only jira software license (not SD)
    Move should be available if person is an approver in Issue
    It should have a single choice custom field with project names (destination project)
*/ 

/* Problem(s):
    Jira software license owners cannot update SD Issues Workflows/Fields and etc.
    Jira doesn't allow easy and secure Issue move transition
    SD module has other fields and functionality that doesn't exist in jira software
*/

/* Workarounds:
    Use a groovy script for manual Issue "move"
    Use plug-in for additional SD buttons and functionality that is available for users with jira software license
    Use plug-ins functionality to move required Issue to other workflow and then add groovy script to move issue
*/

/* Idea:
    1. Add plug-in, selected: Action for Jira Service Desk
    2. Update Workflow with additional Move Issue status (reached for certain statuses?/all statuses?)
    3. Create a custom single choice field (with prebuilt project names)
    4. Add script (listener?) for workflow trasitions and if it matches requirements - move issue

    By "Move Issue" -> prob. create new Issue in selected project (custom single choice field)
    Copy the values of SD Issue to newly created Issue / Add SD Issue participants to newly created Issue
    Delete? SD Issue
